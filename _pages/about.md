### Unique Custom Fine Art Jewelry from professional Designer

NEOR brand is derived from the name of Neor Lake.
Neor Lake (Persian: دریاچه نِئور) is a shallow lake located in 48 km from Ardabil in Ardabil Province in the Baghru mountain range in North West Iran. This lake was formed due to two fault zones during the Eocene period.
The lake is situated at the lower slopes of Baghru Heights of the Talysch Mountains. Elevation of the lake is 2,500 metres (8,200 ft) above mean sea level. It is 48 kilometres (30 mi) to the south east of Ardabil on Khalkhal Road out of which 18 kilometres (11 mi) is a hill section. The lake emerged during the Eocene geologic time scale. The Neor fault and another fault on the western part of the lake, which were active from the Eocene period, have contributed to the emergence of this lake. The basin receives an annual rainfall of 400 millimetres (16 in) with cold mountainous climate.

A sample of peat deposit (30 centimetres (12 in) in diameter core sample) from the bed of the lake, from its northeastern corner, was taken by coring. This was subject to studies to determine the age of the stratification and the type of biodiversity which existed when it was formed. The pollen spectra revealed a 6,500 year old sequence comprising remnants of pollen and beetle. Coprophagous and coprophilous species of pollen were identified. The studies indicated an "open steppe landscape", akin to the present day Irano-Turanian (IT) floristic region in the highlands, in respect of agro-pastoral cultural vocations and the closeness to the eastern mesic temperate Hyrcanian forest. The insect and pollen evidence conforms to the archaeological evidence in the region. Chironomid and geochemical analyses on the lake Neor highlight hydrologic variations on the lake since the Lateglacial with alternation of drier and wetter period.
